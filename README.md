# DiCoW-v1: Diarization-Conditioned Whisper for Target Speaker Automatic Speech Recognition

DiCoW (Diarization-Conditioned Whisper) enhances OpenAIâ€™s Whisper ASR model by integrating **speaker diarization** for multi-speaker transcription. The app leverages `pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1` to segment speakers and provides diarization-conditioned transcription for long-form audio inputs.

## Features

- **Multi-Speaker ASR**: Handles multi-speaker audio using diarization-aware transcription.
- **Flexible Input Sources**:
  - **Microphone**: Record and transcribe live audio.
  - **Audio File Upload**: Upload pre-recorded audio files for transcription.
- **Diarization Support**: Powered by `pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1` for accurate speaker segmentation.
- **Built with ðŸ¤— Transformers**: Uses the latest Whisper checkpoints for robust transcription.
