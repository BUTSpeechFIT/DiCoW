        ## Features

        - **Multi-Speaker ASR**: Handles multi-speaker audio using diarization-aware transcription.  
        - **Flexible Input Sources**:  
          - **Microphone**: Record and transcribe live audio.  
          - **Audio File Upload**: Upload pre-recorded audio files for transcription.  
        - **Diarization Support**: Powered by `pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1` for accurate speaker segmentation.  
        - **Built with ðŸ¤— Transformers**: Uses the latest Whisper checkpoints for robust transcription.  

        **Disclaimer**: This version of DiCoW currently supports **English only** and is still under **active development**. Expect frequent updates and feature improvements.
